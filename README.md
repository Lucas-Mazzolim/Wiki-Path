# Wiki-Path

The game is inspired by the "six degrees of separation" rule, which suggests that any two people on Earth are connected by, at most, six handshakes. This concept can be applied to almost any network of interconnected objects — including websites. Here, it’s used to explore Wikipedia, finding the shortest path between any two articles you choose. Try it with your favorite topics and see how everything is connected. Have fun! 

The features of the site will eventually be expanded to include more possibilities for scraping Wikipedia.
